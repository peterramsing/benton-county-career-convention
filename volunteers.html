  <h3 class="volunteers-info__title">Career Speakers</h3>

  <p class="volunteers-info__copy">
    Students will attend three career occupation panels. Each panel has three speakers specific to a career track. For example, if a student chooses protective services, a police officer, fireman, and sheriff will speak during the session. Each speaker has 5-8 minutes to present on their career. Speakers will provide students with a snapshot of a typical day in the life of that profession - what type of education is required for the field, words of advice, etc. A five minute Q and A will be available for students at the end of the session. Career speakers will not have computer access for PowerPoint presentations. Career speakers will present during one of the morning sessions, 10:15 a.m. - 12:00 p.m., or one of the afternoon sessions, 12:50 p.m. - 2:00 p.m. Career speakers will need to arrive 30 minutes prior to your presentation and check-in at the registration table in the LaSells Stewart Center. Career Occupation Panels will be located in the LaSells Stewart Center, as well as the CH2M Hill Alumni Center.

  <h3 class="volunteers-info__title">Mock Interviews</h3>
  <p class="volunteers-info__copy">
    Prior to the Career Convention, students will be building their resumes, as well as developing their interviewing skills. At the event, mock interviewers will be given students to interview. Each interview will be <strong>10 minute</strong>. We encourage mock interviewers to interview students throughout the entire event: 10:15 a.m. - 2:00 p.m. We understand other time commitments may preclude participation during the entire time. In the event of schedule conflicts, we can schedule mock interviewers for the morning session, 10:15 a.m. - 12:00 p.m., or the afternoon session, 12:50 p.m. - 2:00 p.m. Mock interviewers will need to arrive 15 minutes prior to your shift and check-in at the registration table in the CH2M Hill Alumni Center. Mock Interviews will take place in the CH2M Hill Alumni Center Ballroom.
